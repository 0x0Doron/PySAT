## No longer support :(

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PySAT is a personal project that I started building for a school project.
The idea was to create a tool to scan different devices connected to the internet and learn new concepts.

### Features
- [x] Port scanner
- [x] Banner grabbing
- [x] Anonymize with proxies
- [x] String encoding/decoding/detection
- [x] Image/PDF metadata

## Installation

Just download or clone this repository. I recommend you to create a python3 virtualenv.

Install all the dependencies:

```python
  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you want to display the app with a desktop window install also pywebview:


```python
  pip install pywebview[qt]
```

If not, you can access the app with any web browser.

Launch the app:

```python
  python pysat.py
```
