# PySAT TFG DAM

## No longer support :(

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PySAT is a personal project that I started building for a school project.

The idea was to create a tool to scan different types of devices connected to the internet.
This could be very fun and interesting, but I have recently started working and I don't have neither 
time nor desire to continue this project.

When I started this, I didn't know how to structure a project, as I said, I was still studying.
So, if you are a brave adventurer and want to see the bowels of my project ( code :) ), DO IT 
AT YOUR OWN RISK. But know, that I enjoyed and learned a lot of new concepts while I was developing.

## Installation

Just download or clone this repository. I recommend you to create a python3 virtualenv.

Install all the dependencies:

```python
  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you want to display the app with a desktop window install also pywebview:


```python
  pip install pywebview[qt]
```

If not, you can access the app with any web browser.

Launch the app:

```python
  python pysat.py
```
