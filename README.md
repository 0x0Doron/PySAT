## No longer support :(

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PySAT is a personal project that I started building for a school project.

The idea was to create a tool to scan different types of devices connected to the internet.
This could be very fun and interesting, but I have recently started working and I don't have neither 
time nor desire to continue this project.

When I started this, I didn't know how to structure a project, as I said, I was still studying.
So, if you are a brave adventurer and want to see the bowels of my project ( code :) ), DO IT 
AT YOUR OWN RISK. But know, that I enjoyed and learned a lot of new concepts while I was developing.
